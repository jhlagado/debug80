## Platforms

Each platform has its own README with a full hardware summary, memory map,
ports, and emulator notes.

- TEC-1: `src/platforms/tec1/README.md`
- Simple: `src/platforms/simple/README.md`

Shared timing utilities live in `src/platforms/cycle-clock.ts`.
Serial bit-bang helpers live in `src/platforms/serial/bitbang-uart.ts`.
