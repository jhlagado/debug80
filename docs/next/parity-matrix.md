# AZM Next Parity Matrix

Status: post-promotion differential closeout (2026-05-23)

This matrix tracks the observable behavior AZM Next must match before it can
replace the current implementation.

Legend:

- `not started`
- `scaffolded`
- `partial`
- `compatible`
- `intentionally different`

## Remaining partial rows

- **Lowered `.z80`**: expanded-source passthrough is implemented; instruction-level
  normalization and external ASM80 validator parity are deferred.
- **Listing / D8**: emitted for API/CLI paths; full golden comparison against
  current listing/D8 corpora is not yet part of differential gates.
- **CLI flags**: core default artifact set and register-care flags are covered;
  exhaustive CLI contract matrix parity is tracked in root AZM tests, but not
  every matrix row has a dedicated promoted-root contract test yet.

## Unsupported root fixtures (25)

See `test/differential/unsupported-fixtures.ts` for the explicit roster and
evidence buckets (`diagnostic-wording`, `visible-op-diagnostic`, `include-directive`).
These are intentional differential exclusions until wording or scope is reconciled.

## Classification Rule

When AZM Next differs from current AZM, classify the difference as one of:

- AZM Next bug
- current AZM bug
- intentional spec tightening
- historical behavior outside the replacement target
- undefined behavior now made explicit

Only intentional differences should survive promotion.
