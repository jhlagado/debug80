# AZM language direction

Status: design discussion capture
Date: 2026-05-12

## Purpose

AZM is the new project direction split from the ZAX codebase after the 0.3
release line. ZAX 0.3 remains the preserved structured-assembler release. AZM
starts from the focused Z80 assembler baseline and builds upward one small,
assembly-first feature at a time.

The project name is **AZM** because it contains both "assembler" and "Z80" in a
short form that works as a project name, CLI name, and source extension. The
native extended source extension should be `.azm`, while ordinary `.asm` and
`.z80` source can remain accepted compatibility inputs where they fit the
documented baseline.

AZM should not present itself as a full ASM80 replacement. ASM80 is permissive,
forgiving, and syntax-heavy. AZM uses a proven ASM80-style subset as a practical
starting point, but it should become a stricter and more focused assembler.

## Project split

The split is conceptual first and repository-level second:

- ZAX 0.3 is the preserved public release line for the earlier structured
  assembler language.
- AZM is a new project built from the current assembler-compatible codebase.
- AZM should keep the compatibility smoke gates as its foundation, but should
  not inherit every ZAX or ASM80 feature by default.
- Old ZAX/Zags ideas are a reservoir, not a migration checklist.

The core question for every feature is not "can old ZAX do this?" or "does
ASM80 accept this?" The question is whether the feature helps a Z80 assembly
programmer express machine-level intent more clearly.

## Language stance

AZM should be strict, modern, and assembly-first:

- The machine must remain visible.
- Compatibility should be corpus-driven.
- Errors should be precise rather than forgiving.
- Native AZM style should prefer a clean dotted directive family such as
  `.org`, `.equ`, `.db`, `.dw`, `.ds`, and `.include`.
- Legacy forms such as `ORG`, `EQU`, `DB`, `DW`, and `DS` can be accepted as
  compatibility aliases, but should not be the style taught in AZM-native
  examples.
- Macros, broad directive coverage, alias dialects, and unusual assembler
  variants should stay out of scope unless a real corpus forces a concrete
  decision.

The long-term posture is:

> AZM accepts enough legacy assembly to be useful, but teaches and enforces a
> cleaner assembler dialect over time.

## Compatibility input and AZM-native style

AZM should distinguish compatibility input from native style.

Compatibility input:

- accepts documented ASM80-style forms needed by real source corpora
- keeps `.asm` and `.z80` useful for existing programs
- allows directive aliases where they normalize to the same underlying
  assembler operation

AZM-native style:

- uses `.azm` as the preferred extension
- documents dotted directives as canonical
- introduces new language features only where they compose with ordinary
  assembly
- may eventually support a strict native mode that rejects undotted legacy
  directives unless compatibility aliases are explicitly enabled

This gives AZM a migration path without letting old assembler permissiveness
define the language.

## Directive aliases

Directive aliases are a narrow compatibility and style mechanism. They are not
macros and should not add computation power.

Examples:

- `DB` aliases `.db`
- `DW` aliases `.dw`
- `DS` aliases `.ds`
- `ORG` aliases `.org`
- `EQU` aliases `.equ`

The alias mechanism should be limited to directives whose variant syntax has the
same semantics after normalization. It should not become a general text
substitution system, an opcode alias system, or a way to emulate every historical
assembler dialect.

Over time, AZM can add linting or formatting support that encourages canonical
native spelling:

```asm
.org 4000h
start:
    ld a, 42
message:
    .db "OK", 0
buffer:
    .ds 32
```

## AST ops instead of text macros

AZM should continue to reject text macros as a core language feature. Macro
systems encourage string substitution, accidental capture, generated symbol
names, and obscure control flow.

The preferred abstraction mechanism is the existing ZAX-style `op` concept,
adapted carefully for AZM:

- parsed as AST, not text
- overloadable by operand shape and type
- able to expand into ordinary assembly
- constrained by explicit rules rather than textual substitution
- suitable for reusable instruction patterns and small assembly idioms

AST ops should come back fairly early because they provide power without
requiring the return of high-level structured syntax. They also give programmers
a disciplined alternative to macros.

The design goal is:

> Users should build reusable assembly idioms with typed, overloadable ops, not
> with text substitution.

## Structured programming should not come first

AZM should not rush back into old ZAX structured programming. Assembly
programmers need to see and reason about jumps, labels, branches, registers,
stack effects, and memory layout.

Before adding built-in `if`, `while`, `repeat`, or function-like syntax, AZM
should first provide lower-level compile-time facilities that let programmers
construct structured assembly from first principles.

The most promising facility is a small Forth-inspired assembly control stack.

## Assembly control stack

AZM should consider a narrow compile-time control stack inspired by Forth
control-flow compilation. This is not Forth as a language. It is not a second
expression evaluator, runtime stack model, or self-hosting metaprogramming
system.

The control stack exists for:

- forward references
- backpatching
- loop marks
- unresolved branch sites
- structured nesting validation
- compile-time construction of branch-based control flow

The value of the stack is that it removes the need to create user-visible local
symbol names for every small control-flow shape. Instead of manually inventing
labels such as `skip_1`, `else_2`, or `loop_3`, structured ops can push and
resolve typed compile-time items.

The stack should be structured, not general-purpose:

- top-of-stack operations only at first
- no arbitrary `swap`, `rot`, `pick`, or similar stack shuffling
- typed entries rather than raw numbers
- every pushed item must be resolved, consumed, or explicitly discarded in a
  valid way
- diagnostics should explain structural mismatches
- user-defined ops that interact with the control stack should declare their
  stack effect

## Control stack item types

The control stack should not store only the current value of `$`. A forward
branch needs more than a location; it needs a patchable site and a resolution
rule.

Likely item types:

- `mark`: a resolved assembly location, usually the current assembly pointer
- `patch`: a handle to an emitted but unresolved operand
- `frame`: an optional typed grouping marker for higher-level structures

A patch item should carry enough metadata to validate and resolve it:

```text
patch {
  site: emitted operand location
  kind: rel8 | abs16
  source: branch instruction location
  owner: optional structure id
}
```

This lets AZM check that:

- `jr` targets fit in `rel8`
- `jp` targets fit in `abs16`
- a patch is resolved exactly once
- a `then`-style operation closes the right pending patch
- an `else`-style operation transforms the right pending structure
- end of assembly rejects unresolved control-stack entries

## Primitive surface

The primitive syntax is undecided. Two plausible directions are:

1. dot-prefixed directives, such as `.mark`, `.patch`, and `.resolve`
2. a distinct compile-time prefix, such as `@mark` and `@resolve`

Dot directives fit assembler tradition because these are assembler-time
actions. A distinct prefix makes AZM compile-time control visibly separate from
ordinary directives.

The important design decision is not the prefix yet. The important decision is
that the primitive surface should expose typed patch and mark operations, not
hidden high-level control flow.

Conceptual examples:

```asm
; Push a mark for the current location.
.mark

; Emit a branch with an unresolved rel8 target and push a patch handle.
; Exact syntax still needs design.
jr z, <patch>

; Resolve the top patch to the current location.
.resolve

; Emit a backward branch to the top mark.
jr <mark>
```

These examples are illustrative. They are not final syntax.

## Ops layered over the control stack

The main reason to expose a small control stack is to allow structured assembly
to be built as library-level ops rather than as privileged syntax.

Conceptually:

```asm
op if_z  ( -- patch )
    jr nz, <patch>
end

op then  ( patch -- )
    .resolve
end
```

A loop shape could be built similarly:

```asm
op begin  ( -- mark )
    .mark
end

op again  ( mark -- )
    jr <mark>
end
```

Again, this is design notation, not final AZM syntax. The point is that AZM can
ship primitive control-stack operations and allow disciplined `op`s to build
structured control flow on top.

This gives AZM structured power without making structure magical.

## Formal arguments, locals, globals, arrays, and records

The long-term typed features should also be reintroduced assembly-first.

Likely order:

1. value-level globals and named memory declarations
2. typed arrays and records as layout tools
3. named access syntax for memory slots and fields
4. explicit calling-convention annotations
5. formal arguments and locals as names for register, stack, or frame-relative
   conventions
6. structured control conveniences only after the lower-level mechanisms are
   clear

This means avoiding early resurrection of old `func` semantics if they imply too
much hidden machinery. A routine or procedure model should describe a calling
convention, not pretend the Z80 has native functions.

Typed storage should remain a value-level feature. Raw labels remain
address-level assembler symbols. That distinction should survive the split from
ZAX.

## Non-goals

AZM should not try to become:

- a full ASM80 clone
- a permissive historical assembler dialect aggregator
- a macro preprocessor
- a Forth system
- a Pascal or C compiler with Z80 syntax
- a resurrection of all old ZAX/Zags features

The guiding principle is to add only features that help an assembly programmer
write clearer, safer, more maintainable Z80 code while preserving direct
visibility of the generated machine behavior.

## Open design questions

These questions should be resolved before implementation:

1. Should control-stack primitives use dotted directives, a new `@` prefix, or a
   namespaced directive form?
2. How should an `op` declare its control-stack effect?
3. Should directive aliases be fixed, configurable, or mode-dependent?
4. Should `.azm` default to stricter native style than `.asm` and `.z80`?
5. How much of the existing ZAX `op` implementation can be reused without
   reintroducing old high-level assumptions?
6. What is the smallest branch/fixup primitive set that can express useful
   `if`/`then`, `if`/`else`/`then`, `begin`/`again`, and `begin`/conditional
   loop patterns?

## Near-term recommendation

Preserve the current compatibility baseline as the floor, then design AZM in
this order:

1. rename and reposition project identity around AZM
2. document compatibility mode versus AZM-native mode
3. implement or formalize directive alias normalization
4. bring back AST ops as the macro replacement
5. design the compile-time control stack before adding built-in structured
   control
6. add typed memory layout only when its assembler-facing model is clear

The next development step should be a focused design spec for directive aliases,
AST ops, and the assembly control stack. Implementation should wait until those
interfaces are explicit enough to test.
