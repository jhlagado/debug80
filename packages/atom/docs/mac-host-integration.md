# Mac host and native Atom integration

`assembleAtomProject` is the first complete host-to-Z80 assembly entry. The Mac
host reads the project, resolves `%INCLUDE` dependencies and `INCBIN` inputs,
evaluates host conditionals, and masks or lowers host-owned syntax. Debug80
then executes the native Atom tokenizer, symbol table, statements, encoder,
patch resolver, and multipart driver.

```js
import {
  assembleAtomProject,
  materializeAtomGeneration,
} from "./src/host/index.mjs";

const result = await assembleAtomProject({
  root: "/absolute/project/root",
  entry: "src/main.asm",
  definitions: { DEBUG: 1 },
  target: { start: 0x4000, capacity: 0x2000 },
});

const { base, bytes } = materializeAtomGeneration(result.generation);
```

The `atom` executable wraps this API with deterministic artifact rendering and
atomic generation publication. [`command-line.md`](command-line.md) documents
the installed command.

## Execution boundary

The host snapshots each prepared compiler buffer, constructs the 15-byte native
build descriptor and one five-byte descriptor per source part, then enters
`AtomAssemble` with IX pointing at the build descriptor. Source bytes remain in
the JavaScript snapshots. When native execution reaches `AtomSourceReadByte`,
the runner returns the byte selected by A, the part ordinal, and HL, the
logical offset. The native driver processes an ordered descriptor stream and
contains no filesystem logic.

The runner checks the return PC, final SP, stack canaries, descriptors, and
every immutable code/table interval after the call. It rejects an unknown part
or an offset outside the immutable snapshot before returning control to native
code. The execution account records the number of source reads separately from
the output-service trace.

The native image contains six fail-closed sink stubs. Debug80 stops at each
entry address and transfers the register arguments to the host memory sink:

| Native call | Host record |
| --- | --- |
| `AtomSinkBegin` | Opens one tentative generation. |
| `AtomSinkImageByte` | Appends one bank-zero IMAGE byte. |
| `AtomSinkPatchByte` | Appends one final one-byte PATCH. |
| `AtomSinkPatchWord` | Appends one final little-endian two-byte PATCH. |
| `AtomSinkCommit` | Validates and retains the completed logical generation. |
| `AtomSinkAbort` | Discards all tentative records. |

The host supplies the returned A and carry values and resumes at the native
return address. A JavaScript exception inside a service becomes status `$EF`,
which lets the native driver take its ordinary failure path and call abort.
Runtime budget or halt failures also abort an open host generation.

`generation.images` and `generation.patches` are frozen append-only logical
records with source positions. `generation.layout` records `ORG` and
uninitialized `DS` extents, and `generation.symbols` records successful label
and `EQU` definitions before private-scope eviction. `generation.highWater`
retains the greatest address reached by output, `ORG`, or an uninitialized
`DS` reservation even when the final cursor later moves backward. The byte
payloads are frozen number arrays.
`materializeAtomGeneration` returns a new `Uint8Array`, so changing that copy
cannot alter the committed generation.

An active `INCBIN` line reaches the native core as an equal-length initialized
`DS` statement. The runner retains the binary snapshot keyed by source part and
line, substitutes those bytes in `AtomSinkImageByte`, and checks the exact byte
count before commit. The six-call native sink ABI does not change.

## Current target rules

Native Atom currently emits flat bank-zero output. The integrated resolver
rejects nonzero source placement before starting Debug80. The memory sink also
checks every bank argument as a defensive invariant.

The target start and capacity are unsigned 16-bit descriptor fields. Their sum
must be at most `$FFFF`; the current half-open native range cannot represent an
end address of `$10000`. IMAGE and PATCH records must remain inside that range.
The runner observes native `ORG` and uninitialized `DS` entries without
changing their Z80 implementation. It retains their logical high-water mark
and exact directive position. The commit check therefore catches an
intermediate cursor or reservation outside the target range even if a later
`ORG` returns the final cursor to a valid address.

IMAGE records may leave forward gaps but may not descend or overlap. PATCH
records can modify an earlier IMAGE byte once. A backward `ORG` is valid while
the next IMAGE remains at or beyond the prior IMAGE end. Earlier `DS` extent is
still retained in the materialized range.

## Structured diagnostics

Preparation failures remain `SourcePreparationError` values. Native or adapter
failures use `AtomAssemblyError` with a category and code. A native source
diagnostic includes:

- logical source identity and zero-based part ordinal;
- exact source byte offset;
- one-based line and byte column calculated from the original unmasked source;
- native driver, statement, and nested status values; and
- the unpacked case-folded name for a final undefined symbol.

Equal-length preprocessing masks and `INCBIN` lowering preserve the offset
relation. An error in an included file therefore names that file rather than
the entry file or an anonymous concatenated stream.

## Host proof memory layout

The Debug80 integration uses this measured layout:

| Region | Address | Bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Linked native core, fixed workspace, and host stubs | `$0000..$306C` | 12,396 |
| Free space below the descriptor bank boundary | `$306C..$4000` | 3,988 |
| Build descriptor | `$4000..$400F` | 15 |
| Free descriptor gap | `$400F..$4100` | 241 |
| Symbol arena | `$4100..$7500` | 13,312 |
| Pending-reference arena | `$7500..$8800` | 4,864 |
| Free arena gap | `$8800..$9000` | 2,048 |
| Maximum part descriptors | `$9000..$94FB` | 1,275 |
| Host-free memory below the proof stack | `$94FB..$FE00` | 26,885 |
| Proof stack | `$FE00..$FF00` | 256 |
| Reserved top page | `$FF00..$10000` | 256 |

The symbol arena holds at most 1,664 simultaneous eight-byte records. Private
records remain transient across global scopes. The pending arena holds 694
complete seven-byte records. These are Mac-host proof capacities, not a proposed
TEC-1 deployment map; the TEC operating layer will choose its own symbol,
pending, adapter-state, and stack regions.

## Public modules

`src/host/index.mjs` exports:

- `assembleAtomProject` for filesystem preparation followed by native assembly;
- `assembleResolvedAtomProject` for an already prepared ordered project;
- `resolveAtomProject` for preparation alone;
- `createMemoryAtomSink` and `materializeAtomGeneration` for logical output;
- NOBJ, binary, HEX, listing, and D8 renderers;
- atomic artifact-set publication;
- `loadNativeAtomCore` for the pinned strict-contract image; and
- deterministic Atom-to-AZM and self-host source translation;
- `createSelfHostedAtomCore` for second-generation proof execution; and
- `AtomAssemblyError`, native limits, and host sink status constants.

The runner reads `assets/native-core.json` and verifies its SHA-256. AZM is used
only by the development generator and stale-asset check; it is absent from the
installed package.

## Verification

```sh
npm run test:host
npm run verify:native-source
npm run measure:host-native
npm run measure:self-host
```

The focused integration tests cover host preprocessing through native output,
forward patch timing, exact included-file and undefined-name diagnostics,
nonzero bank rejection, sink status and exception failures, append-only `ORG`
behavior, target commit bounds, the 65,535-byte source boundary, invalid source
service reads, deterministic fresh runs, `DS` high-water retention,
intermediate `ORG` and `DS` range failures, fail-closed stubs, the complete 64
KiB map, and runtime-budget cleanup.
The binary-inclusion proofs additionally cover snapshot stability, path and
size failures, exact initialized bytes, native address calculation, bridge
count mismatches, listing text, and D8 data ranges.
