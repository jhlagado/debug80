# TEC-1 deployment design

Atom's native assembler is complete and fits one 16 KiB bank. It now has a
proved Z80 adapter from its compact callbacks to the shared named-object
request, while TECM8 exposes that request for transactional output. A TEC-FS
source provider, include resolver, launcher, bank placement, and final RAM map
are still deployment work.

## Portable native core

The native core performs tokenization, expressions, symbols, private-scope
eviction, instructions, directives, forward patch decisions, final undefined
checks, and build lifecycle control. It depends on neither Node nor a
filesystem. Its public entry is `AtomAssemble`, which consumes ordered source
descriptors and caller-owned symbol and pending arenas.

The current checked image is linked at `$0000` for Debug80. Its linked extent is
Measured 12,396 bytes, leaving Measured 3,988 bytes below `$4000`. A TEC target
may keep that placement or relink the same modules at a target-specific ROM or
bank origin. Relinking must be followed by the complete strict-contract and
runtime proof battery; the Mac address is not a portable absolute contract.

## Required operating services

A TEC adapter must provide `AtomSourceReadByte`. The call receives a source-part
ordinal in A and a logical 16-bit offset in HL, then returns the selected byte
in A with carry clear. The linked fallback reads a memory interval directly;
an adapter may route the same entry to a filesystem, serial stream, or banked
storage cache. The native tokenizer retains only its 256-byte lexeme buffer.

The checked named-object adapter associates each ordinal with a named source
object, keeps one read handle active, and uses a 128-byte cache with absolute
seek for non-sequential reads. Source and output calls can use different
selectors. This distinction matters on TECM8: the existing eight-slot private
object arena is suitable for transactional output but cannot define Atom's
source capacity.

The TEC source provider will expose ordinary TEC-FS catalogue files through
the read operations of the shared ABI. After resolving an include path, the
resolver can retain the catalogue's one-byte file ID. The final assembly stage
therefore needs one byte per source ordinal, not a copy of every path. This
preserves Atom's 255-part driver domain within a bounded native memory account.

A TEC adapter must provide the six sink calls documented in `output-abi.md`:

- begin one tentative generation;
- append an IMAGE byte;
- append a final byte PATCH;
- append a final little-endian word PATCH;
- commit with the final cursor and remaining capacity; and
- abort an open generation.

The Debug80 image contains 8 bytes of fail-closed stubs at those names. They
return failure when executed directly. A hardware build must replace or route
those entries to real operating services; copying the pinned Mac image to the
TEC-1 is not enough.

The sink can use sequential storage. The retained named-object profile writes a
flat target image: it fills forward gaps with zero bytes, applies PATCH data by
bounded seek, restores the append cursor, and commits only after filling to the
observed high-water mark. IMAGE and PATCH remain ordered compiler callbacks;
they do not become public filesystem operations. NOBJ, Intel HEX, listings, and
D8 maps remain optional renderings above the object service.

## Source loading

The settled host pipeline is still suitable on the TEC-1:

```text
entry source
    -> dependency resolver and conditional preprocessor
    -> ordered source parts
    -> source provider
    -> AtomAssemble
```

The preprocessor masks directives and inactive source with spaces and lowers
`INCBIN` to an equal-length initialized reservation. The loader must retain
each part's logical ordinal, original identity, and binary snapshots for
diagnostics and output substitution. It need not concatenate files or expose
filesystem calls to the assembler.

The Mac runner keeps every prepared part in an immutable host snapshot and
intercepts `AtomSourceReadByte`. Each part may contain at most 65,535 bytes
because the native offset is 16-bit. Atom's self-host source has five content
parts totalling Measured 101,492 bytes plus a small entry part. No source page
is copied into Z80 RAM.

## RAM decision

With less than 24 KiB of effective RAM, the Mac proof capacities still require
careful sizing. The 714-byte fixed workspace, symbol arena, pending arena,
maximum descriptors, and 256-byte stack consume Measured 20,436 bytes. A 24
KiB budget leaves 4,140 bytes for source-service state and the output adapter.

The source service removes the former whole-part residency problem. The proved
adapter uses a 128-byte cache and 399 bytes of caller-owned common workspace.
The composed core and adapter occupy Measured 13,511 bytes, leaving Measured
2,873 bytes in the bank. TEC-FS catalogue lookup, dependency resolution, and
the launcher remain separate unmeasured accounts; they must not be squeezed
into that margin without a fresh linked measurement.

A TEC filesystem adapter must also implement the measured Mac `INCBIN`
contract: confined snapshot reads relative to the containing source, whole-file
length validation, and exact IMAGE-byte substitution before commit. Its code,
metadata, and buffering cost remain unmeasured for TEC hardware.

Symbol capacity is another target choice. Use eight bytes for every permanent
global plus the peak private scope, and seven bytes for the peak concurrent
unresolved list. Reducing those arenas reduces maximum program complexity but
does not change output bytes.

## Deployment acceptance proof

A TEC adapter is ready only when all of these claims are measured:

- the final linked core plus adapter remains at or below 16,384 resident bytes;
- the complete target memory map has no overlap and includes stack guards;
- every source read preserves part identity and logical offsets, including
  reads across any adapter cache boundary;
- begin/commit/abort counts are exact on success and injected failures;
- IMAGE and PATCH output survives power-safe publication or a documented
  recoverable protocol;
- one full Atom self-build matches the pinned AZM image at every initialized
  address and across the complete resident extent; and
- the second Atom-built generation is identical to the first.

Until those checks pass on the selected TEC operating layer, Atom is a working
Mac command-line assembler and a proved portable Z80 core, not a finished
TEC-1 application image.
