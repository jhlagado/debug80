# Appendix A — Directory and file reference

[← Appendices](index.md) | [Build-flow reference →](b-build-flow-reference.md)

This appendix maps the files that implement, generate, execute, and prove Atom.
The narrative chapters explain how the files interact; this reference identifies
the owner of a behavior quickly.
