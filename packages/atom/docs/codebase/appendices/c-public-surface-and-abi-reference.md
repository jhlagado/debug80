# Appendix C — Public surface and ABI reference

[← Build-flow reference](b-build-flow-reference.md)

This appendix lists the package functions and native entries that form Atom's
current integration boundaries.

## Package identity

The npm package is:

```text
atom-z80
```

`package.json` exposes one ESM package path backed by `src/host/index.mjs` and
one executable:

```text
IMPORT:  atom-z80
BINARY:  atom
```

The package requires Node 20 or later. It bundles
`@jhlagado/debug80-runtime`. AZM is a development-only dependency and is not
required by an installed build.

## High-level host functions

| Export | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `assembleAtomProject(options)` | Resolve a filesystem project, preprocess it, lower `INCBIN`, and execute native Atom |
| `resolveAtomProject(options)` | Run only filesystem preparation and return ordered source parts |
| `renderAtomArtifacts(result, options)` | Render NOBJ, BIN, HEX, listing, and D8 in memory |
| `publishAtomArtifacts(destination, baseName, artifacts)` | Publish one content-addressed artifact generation and atomically select it through `current` |

The current main build option shape is:

```js
{
  root,
  entry,
  definitions,
  placement,
  limits,
  target: { start, capacity },
  maxInstructions,
  maxCycles,
  sink,
}
```

The function throws structured `SourcePackagerError` or `AtomAssemblyError`
instances on failure. A future versioned host facade may convert these to a
tagged result without changing the lower-level functions.

## Native execution functions

| Export | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `loadNativeAtomCore()` | Load and verify the checked Intel HEX and symbol map |
| `assembleResolvedAtomProject(project, options)` | Run an already prepared project through a pinned or supplied native core |
| `createMemoryAtomSink()` | Create the default append-only in-memory generation sink |
| `materializeAtomGeneration(generation, options)` | Produce a new contiguous byte array with IMAGE and PATCH operations applied |
| `NATIVE_ATOM_LIMITS` | Report native part, per-part byte, symbol, pending, and bank limits used by the Mac runner |
| `ATOM_HOST_SINK_STATUS` | Stable host-adapter status values used by the runner and tests |

`assembleResolvedAtomProject()` accepts a development-only `nativeCore` option
in addition to target, budgets, and sink. The self-host proof uses it to execute
the first Atom generation.

## Artifact functions

| Export | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `writeAtomNobj()` | Serialize one committed generation as Atom flat NOBJ 0.2 |
| `parseAtomNobj()` | Validate and summarize Atom NOBJ framing, order, map, count, and CRC |
| `crc16CcittFalse()` | Compute the object stream CRC |
| `writeIntelHex()` | Render a materialized flat image as Intel HEX |
| `writeAtomListing()` | Render original source, final bytes, reservations, and symbols |
| `writeAtomD8()` | Render Debug80 source and symbol metadata |

`renderAtomArtifacts()` calls all current writers and returns:

```js
{
  nobj,
  bin,
  hex,
  listing,
  d8,
  d8Text,
}
```

## Development and proof helpers

| Export | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `translateAtomLineToAzm()` | Translate one prepared Atom source line into AZM syntax |
| `translateResolvedAtomProjectToAzm()` | Produce one AZM oracle source from ordered prepared parts |
| `createSelfHostedAtomCore()` | Recover a runner-compatible native core from one Atom generation |
| `AtomAssemblyError` | Structured error class for execution, artifacts, translation, self-hosting, and publication |

These helpers are exported because the repository's independent proofs and
external engineering tools need them. Ordinary build integration begins with
`assembleAtomProject()`.

## Command-line surface

```text
atom [options] entry.asm
atom --self-host [options]
```

The current options are:

```text
-o, --output DIR
--root DIR
--origin NUMBER
--capacity NUMBER
--entry NUMBER
--fill NUMBER
--self-host
-DNAME[=VALUE]
-h, --help
```

The command publishes NOBJ, BIN, HEX, LST, D8 JSON, and a manifest under one
`current` symlink.

## Native top-level entry

## Public data boundaries

Tool consumers should treat these shapes as integration contracts even though
the package does not yet ship TypeScript declarations:

- resolved project and source-part records;
- source provenance and diagnostic locations;
- committed generation, IMAGE, PATCH, layout, and symbol records;
- rendered artifact object;
- `AtomAssemblyError` category, code, diagnostic, native, execution, and sink
  details;
- Atom NOBJ flat profile 0.2; and
- D8 map output accepted by Debug80.

Workspace addresses, internal native labels, proof stack addresses, native
short names, and private files below `src/host/` are implementation
details. Tools should not derive behavior from them.
