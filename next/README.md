# AZM Next

Status: greenfield replacement track

`next/` is the future-root scaffold for a clean AZM implementation. It mirrors
the repository shape that can later be promoted to the project root when the
replacement is ready.

The current AZM implementation is the behavioral oracle: its tests, fixtures,
corpus comparisons, and documented outputs define compatibility targets. Its
internal module structure is not the architecture for this implementation.

## Rules

- Production code under `next/src/` must not import production code from root
  `src/`.
- Tests under `next/test/` may compare against root fixtures and the current AZM
  CLI when building differential coverage.
- New implementation code should use assembler terms: source lines, labels,
  directives, symbols, sections, fixups, emitted bytes, listings, and metadata.
- High-level ZAX compiler concepts are out of scope.
- Output writers serialize completed assembly results; they must not change
  compilation semantics.

## Layout

```text
next/
  src/       replacement implementation
  test/      next-specific unit, integration, and differential tests
  fixtures/  fixtures owned by the replacement track
  scripts/   helper scripts for parity and differential checks
  docs/      architecture notes and parity tracking
```

See:

- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/parity-matrix.md`
- `docs/promotion-criteria.md`

## Local Checks

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run next:typecheck
npm run next:test
npm run next:check
```

The initial scaffold is intentionally thin. The first real milestone is a
minimal flat assembler path: source text to parsed lines, labels, `ORG`, `EQU`,
`DB`, `DW`, `DS`, a small instruction subset, and binary/HEX output.
