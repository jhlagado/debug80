## Classification Rule

When AZM Next differs from current AZM, classify the difference as one of:

- AZM Next bug
- current AZM bug
- intentional spec tightening
- historical behavior outside the replacement target
- undefined behavior now made explicit

Only intentional differences should survive promotion.
